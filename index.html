          <p class="lead"><strong>EN</strong></p>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <p align="justify">CIMS – Cidnay International Masterclass Series aims to be an event that promotes musical excellence, of an international character, and to inspire the community and younger generations through music.</p>
          <p align="justify">CIMS aims to affirm a holistic vision, providing participants and listeners with undeniable moments of musical subtlety, accompanied by time for relaxation and meditation, time to visit local cultural and environmental heritage, and time for sharing and debate, relating music with architecture, with sculpture, with the life of the community, from different chronological contexts.</p>
          <p align="justify">Thus, CIMS will have has core concept the CONTACT. Contact between teacher and students, between participants of different latitudes, with other expressions and artistic languages, with fields of knowledge and experience complementary to music, with a variety of audiences, partners, between presential and digital. This way, we will fulfill the purpose of offering an inspiring program, rich in content, and that positions itself as an obligatory stop-off point for the most talented musicians.</p>
          <p align="justify">To be held in a city bathed by the Ave river, CIMS will inspire young people through contact with a deep mark of the Baroque architecture, São Bento Monastery. In addition, Santo Tirso is, today, one of the European capitals of contemporary sculpture, with artworks distributed around the city, in spaces of enjoyment, such as squares, gardens and parks.</p>
          <p align="justify">The architectural work of Álvaro Siza Vieira and Eduardo Souto de Moura, Pritzker Prizes, can also be admired, particularly the MIEC, Museu Internacional da Escultura Contemporânea (International Museum of Contemporary Sculpture).</p>
          <p align="justify">It is within this context, of contact between historical and artistic periods, that fit the spaces where the masterclasses will be held, the rehearsals and the final concert, with openness to the local community. Both MIEC and Quinta de Fora are spaces with privileged views, close to the river and the last one property of an Agricultural Professional School.</p>
          <!--p align="justify">The final concert and selected parts of the masterclasses, as well as the debate sessions and an interview to the invited master, will integrate the digital dimension of the program, through the creation of the Cidnay Digital Stage, which will comprise a microsite and coverage on social media.</p-->
          <p align="justify">The accommodation will also have a privileged space, in a charming unit, Cidnay Santo Tirso – Charming Hotel & Executive Center.</p>
          <p align="justify">Finally, the event will assume a vocation of social responsibility, by establishing a partnership with a reference entity, in Portugal, in the childcare for children suffering abuse, to provide, within the program, awareness building amongst the younger generations to the importance of music in their recovery for life.</p>
          <p align="justify">CIMS is seeking to stand in the national and international panorama of the events of artistic and cultural valorization, with a regular character.</p>

He further undertook a session at the Chapelle Musicale Reine Elisabeth in Waterloo, Belgium, where he obtained his diploma, also with the highest distinction.</p>
          <p align="justify">Máté was eleven when he won the Special Prize of the Hungarian Violin Competition for Young Artists.

          <p align="justify">João Abreu was born in 2000, in Porto (Portugal), and began his musical studies at the age of twelve. He studied for six years in a music academy in his hometown, where he received lessons from the teacher Teresa Correia, and is currently studying at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, with the Professors Nobuko Imai and Francien Schatborn.</p>
          <p align="justify">João attended to masterclasses with Pedro Muñoz, Ryszard Wóycicki, Luis Magin Muñiz, Esther van Stralen, Christophe Weidmann, Eva Stegeman, Sven Arne Tepl, Judith Wijzenbeek, Jerzi Kosmala, Sophia Reuter, Máté Szücs, Walter Küssner, Veit Hertenstein, Sophie Arbuckle, Tatjana Masurenko, Veronika Hagen, Pauline Sachse, Lilli Majala, among others, and received several recommendation letters.</p>
          <p align="justify">During his studies, João won an Honorary Award for Outstanding Musicianship at the Peter de Grote Festival (2016), a 3rd prize at the 5th Cidade de Vigo Iberian Competition (2016), a 1st prize ex-aequo at the Vasco Barbosa National Competition (2017) - having the opportunity to perform as a soloist with orchestra, in a live broadcast to the Portuguese classical radio Antena 2 - and a 2nd prize ex-aequo at the International Summer Academy Verão Clássico (2019).</p>

          <h2>Santo Tirso</h2>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <p class="lead"><strong>EN</strong></p>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <p align="justify">Santo Tirso is a city located 24 km from Porto and Guimarães. The nearest airport is less than 20 km away and there are good railway and road connections available. Still from a geographic point of view, this city is located in a point of transition between the Atlantic coast and the inland part of the north of the country.</p>
          <p align="justify">The historical origins are related with the existing monastery, founded (or rebuilt), during the 10th century, by the Benedictine monks. Santo Tirso has held the title of county seat since 1834, keeping a current population of about 70,000 inhabitants. Economically, the textile and clothing industries are well implanted in this region. In terms of areas of interest worth being mentioned, we cannot ignore the Ave river and the countless waterfalls, as well as natural parks and forests, thermal baths, and tourism farms. Additionally, you can also find Romanesque and Baroque monuments, local handicrafts, attend popular festivals and taste the local gastronomy and wines as well as the conventual sweets.</p>
          <p align="justify">San Rosendo, who spent the last part of his life as a bishop in the already notorious cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (968-977), and was the founder of the Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova, which stimulated culture and the development of Christian kingdoms at the threshold of the year thousand, was born in the territory of Santo Tirso, in the current parish of São Miguel do Couto.</p>
          <p align="justify">The quality of life in Santo Tirso is undeniably good and this idea is reinforced by the substantial cultural offer available. Amongst the existing cultural organizations, we can highlight MIEC - International Museum of Contemporary Sculpture, the Municipal Museum Abade Pedrosa (with a vast archaeological collection), the Municipal Historical Archive, the Municipal Library, the Interpretative Center of the Monte Padrão (Archaeological Station), ARTAVE - Artistic Professional School and countless other schools. In addiction, there are also spaces of exhibition and enjoyment, such as the Fábrica de Santo Thyrso and its Nave Cultural, or the Vila das Aves Cultural Center, together with sporting facilities and nature related activities.</p>
          <p align="justify">Santo Tirso can also be proud of having a living heritage of musical ensembles, folklore and theater groups, dance academies, numerous local cultural spaces and festivities. There are several plastic artists who were born or currently reside in this city, amongst whom we name Tomaz Pelayo and José Cavadas, in addition to a vast group of great photographers.</p>
          <p align="justify">It hosts annually an International Guitar Festival.</p>

In 1650, the second cloister would already be built, today integrated into an Agricultural Professional School, together with the buildings of Quinta de Fora (Casa da Eira and Casa Rosae).</p>
          <p align="justify">Quinta de Fora, where the masterclasses will take place, was subject to reconstruction works which aimed to rehabilitate this important building complex, of recognized patrimonial value, and adapting it to accommodate a small hall, an exhibition room, an environmental education center and the professional school of hospitality.</p>

          <p align="justify">A história de Santo Tirso prende-se com a do Mosteiro Beneditino, fundado em 978 da Era Cristã, tornando-se um local de culto e devoção. Em 1650, já estaria construído o segundo claustro, hoje integrado na Escola Profissional Agrícola Conde de S. Bento, juntamente com os edifícios da Quinta de Fora (Casa da Eira e Casa Rosae).</p>
          <p align="justify">A Quinta de Fora, onde vão decorrer as masterclasses, foi alvo de obras que visaram reabilitar este importante conjunto edificado, de reconhecido valor patrimonial, adaptando-o de forma a acolher um pequeno auditório, uma sala de exposições, um centro de educação ambiental e a escola profissional de hotelaria.</p>
